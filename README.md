# Recommendation-System-GitHub
This project focus on developing an recommendation system based on Pyspark to personalized recommend repositories to users in GitHub communities.  
GitHub is one of the most commonly used web-based code repository hosting service. Being able to recommend appropriate projects to users in GitHub opens completely new opportunities for project management. In this work, I developed a repository recommender system using Apache Spark and its ALS algorithm. The data is collected from GitHub API and a series of data preprocessing and preselection make sure the model avoid the problem of cold start. RMSE is used as evaluation matrix and hyperparameter tuning is implemented to improve the performance. The results showed a decent root mean square error (0.3173) as an output of the recommender model.
